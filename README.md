## A Simple Arcade Game: ESL Suite Rocket Adventure Game

ESL Suite Rocket Adventure Game - A game used to kill time for users who are directed to 404 page accidentally.

The game is in ```src/game``` directory and the distribution version is in ```dist/```.

If you want to try it yourself, remember to write:
```javascript
Game.init(YourCanvasId);
```
The parameter ```YourCanvasId``` is the canvas the game will be shown on. The size of the canvas'd better be **1000 x 400** and the height should be no larger than **500**.

Actually the game is too simple to explain anything LOL. It's a simple project for learning and practicing JavaScript. Anyway, have some fun!
